# train-schedule

This program is a simple train scheduler and schedule display.

Users can add trains to the schedule by entering data into the form at the bottom of the screen. 

When the "Submit" button is pressed the input is captured and added to the database. Then the minutes until arrival and arrival times are calculate and the train information is added to the schedule table that is displayed above the data entry form. 

Finally, the schedule display updates at 60 second intervals showing new arrival times and minutes until the next train arrives.
